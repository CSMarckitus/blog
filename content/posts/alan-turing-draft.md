# Wait, Marc, why Alan Turing? 

I know what you’re thinking — he’s the father of computers, a brilliant mathematician, the man who cracked the Enigma code... Maybe, like me a while ago, you’ve also heard that he laid the foundation for what we now call Artificial Intelligence (AI).

But really, is that all there is to Alan Turing? Is that everything a man, whose work makes the internet and modern digital life possible, should be remembered for? What was going through his mind when he created the world’s first computer? And if ideas are shaped by the world around us, what was the environment that influenced Turing, and how can understanding that inspire us today?
