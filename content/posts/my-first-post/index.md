# Why I Started This Blog?
Ever since I was about 8 years old, I’ve been fascinated by computers. I didn’t fully understand what I was doing back then (and, if I’m honest, there’s still a lot I don’t know), but computers have always pushed me to explore the limits of my knowledge. They make me question how the world works, especially how people use them every day without really knowing what goes on behind the screen.

As I started diving deeper into the tech world, I realized something surprising: if I truly wanted to learn more and build things that could make a difference, I needed to expand beyond just computers. Understanding psychology, human behavior, and the world around us became just as important. Technology isn’t just about programming or creating cool animations anymore. Today, it’s about solving real-world problems and improving people's lives in meaningful ways.

Along this journey, I’ve often felt lost—like there’s so much to learn but no clear path to follow. I’ve struggled to find mentors or resources that could answer my "stupid" questions and guide me in the right direction. But instead of being discouraged, it’s made me more determined to figure things out on my own.

**That’s where this blog comes in.**

For a long time, I’ve wanted to share the things that inspire me, the discoveries that blow my mind, and the lessons that keep me hooked on tech. I believe that by sharing these insights, I can help others get excited about learning, too—and maybe give them some direction that I wish I’d had.

This blog isn’t about chasing likes or writing for algorithms. It’s a space where I can freely share what I’m learning, without worrying about rules or popularity contests. My only goal is to create a place where ideas can flow, and people can come to explore and exchange knowledge.

So, welcome to my blog! I’d love to hear your thoughts, your disagreements, and anything else you feel like sharing. I’m always open to new perspectives and eager to keep learning.
